GFG: Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's Algorithm)  
Link: https://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/minimum-spanning-tree/1

Problem:
Given a connected, undirected, weighted graph with V vertices and adjacency list `edges`, 
find the sum of weights of edges in its Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

Approach: Primâ€™s Algorithm (Greedy)
- Use a min-heap (priority queue) to always pick the edge with the smallest weight.
- Start from any node (here node 0).
- Maintain a `visited[]` array to track included nodes.
- For each node added, push all its unvisited neighbors into the min-heap.
- Continue until all vertices are visited, summing selected edge weights.

Time Complexity: O(E log V)  
Space Complexity: O(V + E)
