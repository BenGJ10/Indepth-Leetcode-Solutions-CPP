LeetCode: 739. Daily Temperatures  
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/

Problem:  
Given a list of daily temperatures `temperatures`, return a list `wait` such that `wait[i]` is the number of days you have to wait after the `i`th day to get a warmer temperature. If no future day is warmer, set `wait[i] = 0`.

---

## Brute Force Approach:
- For each day, iterate forward to find the next day with a higher temperature.
- Time Complexity: O(nÂ²) (nested loops for each day comparison).
- Space Complexity: O(1).

---

## Optimal Approach: Monotonic Stack
- Use a stack to store indices of days in **decreasing temperature order**.
- For each temperature:
    1. While the current temperature is greater than the temperature at the top index in the stack:
       - Pop from the stack and calculate wait days (`i - popped index`).
    2. Push the current day's index onto the stack.
- The stack helps efficiently track the "next warmer day".

- Time Complexity: O(n) (each index pushed/popped once).
- Space Complexity: O(n) (stack for indices).

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Pop all indices with lower temperature than current
            while (!st.empty() && temperatures[i] > temperatures[st.top()]) {
                wait[st.top()] = i - st.top(); // Days to wait for a warmer temperature
                st.pop();
            }
